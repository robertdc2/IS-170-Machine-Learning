# Pandas & Feature Engineering

Pandas is a popular Python library used for data analysis and manipulation. It provides a flexible and efficient data structure called a DataFrame, which enables easy handling of structured data. Pandas offers a wide range of functions and operations to load, transform, and analyze datasets, making it an invaluable tool for data scientists.

Feature engineering, on the other hand, is a critical process in machine learning. It involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to enhance the performance of models. Pandas is commonly used in feature engineering tasks as it provides functionalities for data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and creating derived features. By utilizing Pandas for feature engineering, data scientists can extract meaningful insights from data, improve model accuracy, and make better data-driven decisions.
