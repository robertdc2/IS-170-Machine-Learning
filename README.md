# K-Nearest Neighbors

 K-Nearest Neighbors is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the K nearest data points to a given input data point based on a distance metric, and then using the majority vote (for classification) or the average (for regression) of the K nearest neighbors to predict the label or value for the input data point. The choice of K, the number of neighbors, is a hyperparameter that can be tuned to optimize the algorithm's performance. K-Nearest Neighbors is simple and easy to implement, making it a popular choice for many applications such as image recognition, recommendation systems, and anomaly detection.
