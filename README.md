# Association Rules

The association rules algorithm is a data mining technique that discovers relationships between variables in large datasets. It identifies the most frequent co-occurring items or events in a dataset and generates rules that express the likelihood of one item or event occurring given the occurrence of another. These rules are commonly used for market basket analysis, where businesses use the insights gained to optimize product placement and promotional strategies.
