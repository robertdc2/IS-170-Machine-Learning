# Support Vector Machines

Support Vector Machines is a supervised machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. It aims to find a hyperplane that separates the data into two or more classes in the feature space, with the largest possible margin between the classes. SVM achieves this by mapping the data to a high-dimensional space and finding the hyperplane that maximizes the distance between the classes. The algorithm works by identifying a subset of the training data, called support vectors, which lie closest to the decision boundary.
