# Naive Bayes

 Naive Bayes is a machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It is based on Bayes' theorem, which describes the probability of an event given prior knowledge or evidence. Naive Bayes assumes that the features in the dataset are conditionally independent of each other, meaning that the presence or absence of one feature does not affect the presence or absence of other features. This simplifying assumption allows for efficient computation and makes Naive Bayes particularly useful for large-scale datasets. The algorithm calculates the probability of each class given the observed features and selects the class with the highest probability as the predicted class.
